#Mobile Sponza
A version of Sponza I am optimizing and improving for mobile. I am using it for testing in my own projects, and am making it available here for others to use and as a portfolio piece.

These models are meant for use on mobile phones, tablets, and XR headsets.

All final assets meant for use are in the exports folder. 
I would have exported a GLTF file, but my Blender keeps crashing when I try to do it.

I have included the .blend file if anyone wants to poke around there and make their own adjustments.

Forked off of this repository - https://github.com/jimmiebergmann/Sponza
I had to remove the fork to upload Git LFS files.

Below is the Readme from that repository.
